To write this program I first wanted to define the conversion factors since those would crop up again and again
throughout the code. That is why you will see the the miles per kilometer, gallons per liter, kilometer per mile and
liter per gallon defined first. Then you'll see the inputs defined below then. The unit is defined as a standard input
and the distance and gas inputs are defined as floats because they are integers. After that, I defined the first line
of the table that this program will eventually print out.

Following those introductory definitions, I begin a large, all inclusive if-else statement that I broke up into four
separate strings for the four parts of the final output table. The first chunk of strings are the "if" statement.The
first is the Distance string which takes a distance that a user entered and displays it in both USC and Metric units.
The second string is the Gas string which takes an
amount of gas that a user entered and converts it into both gallons and liters and outputs it in the final table. The
third string is the Consumption string which converts and formats all of the values in the Distance and Gas strings and
outputs them with the respective consumption labels, namely miles per gallon and liters per 1/100 kilometers. Finally,
there is the Rating string which interprets the Consumption string and outputs and understandable label that rates the
users gas consumption based upon the variables entered.

It should be noted that all strings are formated to print their values into the proper table.

The next set of strings are nearly identical to the first four but are for the USC "else" statement rather than the
Metric "if" statement. the Distance, Gas, Consumption and Rating strings are all present here and perform the same
functions as described above.
